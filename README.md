let's "play" a translational game the second file is on a language called Sarif Zoran found in Zelda game yet...even if we can try to decode it fully you know...it's like hyperbola!!! but reading it on Kaotican still is a challenge...but it's not impossible...I can assure you it is not just like incomprehensible
let's just play a bit!!!enjoy!!!
